## AlphaEdge Overview
### What is AlphaEdge?
    
AlphaEdge is a cloud-based SMTP provider that allows you to send email without having to maintain email servers. AlphaEdge manages all of the technical details, from scaling the infrastructure to ISP outreach and reputation monitoring to whitelist services and real time analytics.
    
Our goal is to make it as easy as possible to add reliable, scalable email to your application so that you can focus on building the core features of your product.
    
### Who is AlphaEdge for?
    
AlphaEdge is for anyone that needs to send email, whether it’s transactional email or marketing emails and campaigns. We send billions of emails each month, so we can handle your email regardless of volume.
    
#### Developers
    
For developers, it’s super easy to get started. To send email through AlphaEdge from your code, just change your email configuration to point to our servers and include the credentials for your AlphaEdge account, and you’re done. If you’re not already sending email from your app, we have a variety of integration options for you.
    
Once you’ve got email sending squared away, check out some of the other awesome things you can do with our APIs and apps.
    
#### Marketing Campaigns
    
Our Marketing Campaigns feature lets you compose and send email campaigns. We provide list management, delivery scheduling, A/B split testing, email analytics, and dynamic list segmentation. You can take a look at our Marketing Campaigns documentation to learn more.
    
We also provide a robust Marketing Campaigns API if you want to integrate any of these features into your own application.
